# Indium
Adaptation of Indigo (Reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API) for use with Sodium. Requires [Sodium 0.2.0](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/releases/tag/mc1.16.5-0.2.0) or later. (my fork is no longer necessary)

Based heavily upon [Indigo](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.16/fabric-renderer-indigo) (licensed Apache 2.0)
